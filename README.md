## Description
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. My challenge was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

  ## Installation
  First run `npm i` in order to install the dependencies `inquirer` and `mysql`. The application itself can be invoked with `node start.js` in the intergreated termeinal.

  You must also have [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to run the `schema.sql` and `seed.sql`. These files contain a made up employee database that the application can send to and grab from.

  ## Usage
  ![Gif demo note-taker](./demo.gif)
  
  When you run `start.js` in the intergrated terminal, it will prompt you with a list of choices. Select what you would like to do and proceed with your choice.
